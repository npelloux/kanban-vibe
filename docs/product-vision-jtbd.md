## Core Job to be Done

**Job Statement**: When I need to understand and improve my team's software development workflow, I want to safely experiment with different process configurations (WIP limits, worker specialization, task policies), so I can optimize throughput and lead time without disrupting real projects.

**Alternative Job Statement**: When I'm teaching Lean/Agile principles to teams or students, I want to demonstrate abstract concepts like flow efficiency and bottlenecks in an interactive way, so I can create lasting understanding through hands-on experience rather than theoretical lectures.

## Customer Pains

### Undesired Outcomes (things customers want to avoid)
- **Wasted time on ineffective process changes**: Implementing changes that don't improve (or worsen) delivery performance
- **Disengaged training audiences**: Participants who zone out during theoretical explanations and don't retain concepts
