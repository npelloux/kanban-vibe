Generate a comprehensive product vision document using the Jobs to be Done framework to identify user segments, define their goals, capture pains and gains, and outline main product requirements.

## When to Use

- Starting a new product development initiative and need to establish clear vision and direction
- Redefining product strategy to better align with customer needs and outcomes
- Creating alignment across stakeholders on what problem the product solves and for whom
- Validating product-market fit by mapping features to actual customer jobs
- Transitioning from feature-driven to outcome-driven product development

## Context Validation Checkpoints

* [ ] What is the core job that customers are hiring this product to do?
* [ ] Who are the primary user segments and what distinguishes them from each other?
* [ ] What are the current alternatives users employ to get this job done today?
* [ ] What are the desired outcomes that define success from the customer's perspective?
* [ ] What constraints or context factors influence how the job gets done?

## Recipe Steps

### Step 1: Define the Core Job Statement

Identify and articulate the primary job customers need to accomplish, written in the format: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

```markdown
## Core Job to be Done

**Job Statement**: When [situation context], I want to [action/goal], so I can [desired outcome].

**Example**: When I need to share project updates with my team, I want to quickly compile progress reports, so I can keep everyone aligned without spending hours on documentation.
```

### Step 2: Identify and Document User Segments

Map out distinct user segments based on different contexts, needs, or approaches to getting the job done, not just demographics.

```markdown
## User Segments

### Segment 1: [Segment Name]
- **Context**: [When/where they need to do the job]
- **Characteristics**: [Behavioral traits relevant to the job]
- **Current Approach**: [How they solve this today]

### Segment 2: [Segment Name]
- **Context**: [When/where they need to do the job]
- **Characteristics**: [Behavioral traits relevant to the job]
- **Current Approach**: [How they solve this today]
```

### Step 3: Map Job Steps and Customer Journey

Break down the job into sequential steps customers go through, identifying pain points and desired outcomes at each stage.

```markdown
## Job Steps

1. **[Prepare/Plan]**: [What user does to prepare for the job]
   - Pain points: [Current frustrations]
   - Desired outcome: [What success looks like]

2. **[Execute]**: [Core action to accomplish the job]
   - Pain points: [Current frustrations]
   - Desired outcome: [What success looks like]

3. **[Verify/Complete]**: [How user confirms job is done]
   - Pain points: [Current frustrations]
   - Desired outcome: [What success looks like]
```

### Step 4: Capture Customer Pains and Gains

Document specific pains to eliminate and gains to create, organized by importance and satisfaction with current solutions.

```markdown
## Customer Pains

### Undesired Outcomes (things customers want to avoid)
- [Pain point 1]: [Current impact and frequency]
- [Pain point 2]: [Current impact and frequency]

### Obstacles (barriers preventing job completion)
- [Obstacle 1]: [How it blocks progress]
- [Obstacle 2]: [How it blocks progress]

## Customer Gains

### Required Outcomes (must-haves)
- [Required outcome 1]: [Why it's essential]
- [Required outcome 2]: [Why it's essential]

### Desired Outcomes (nice-to-haves)
- [Desired outcome 1]: [How it adds value]
- [Desired outcome 2]: [How it adds value]
```

### Step 5: Define Success Metrics and Outcome Statements

Establish measurable outcomes that indicate the job is done successfully, focusing on direction, unit, and context.

```markdown
## Success Metrics

### Outcome Statements (in format: direction + unit + context)
- Minimize the time it takes to [specific action in job step]
- Increase the likelihood that [desired result happens]
- Minimize the number of [errors, steps, tools needed]

### Key Performance Indicators
- [KPI 1]: [Target value and measurement method]
- [KPI 2]: [Target value and measurement method]
```

### Step 6: Prioritize Main Product Requirements

Translate customer outcomes into product requirements, prioritized by opportunity (importance × satisfaction gap).

```markdown
## Main Product Requirements

### High Priority (High Importance, Low Satisfaction)
1. **[Requirement 1]**: [Feature/capability description]
   - Addresses: [Which pain/outcome]
   - User segments: [Who needs this most]

2. **[Requirement 2]**: [Feature/capability description]
   - Addresses: [Which pain/outcome]
   - User segments: [Who needs this most]

### Medium Priority
[Same structure as above]

### Low Priority (Nice-to-have)
[Same structure as above]
```

### Step 7: Document Vision and Strategic Goals

Synthesize insights into a cohesive product vision statement and strategic goals aligned with customer outcomes.

```markdown
## Product Vision

**Vision Statement**: [1-2 sentences describing the future state when product succeeds]

**Strategic Goals**:
1. [Goal 1]: [How it enables the job to be done better]
2. [Goal 2]: [How it enables the job to be done better]
3. [Goal 3]: [How it enables the job to be done better]

## Competitive Differentiation
- **vs. Current Alternatives**: [How product improves on existing solutions]
- **Unique Value**: [What makes this approach different/better]
```

### Step 8: Create Validation and Evolution Plan

Outline how to validate assumptions and evolve the vision based on customer feedback and market learning.

```markdown
## Validation Plan

### Key Assumptions to Test
1. [Assumption 1]: [How to validate]
2. [Assumption 2]: [How to validate]

### Research Methods
- Customer interviews focusing on [specific job steps/outcomes]
- Observational studies of [users doing the job]
- Prototype testing measuring [specific success metrics]

## Evolution Criteria
- Review and update vision quarterly based on [specific signals]
- Pivot indicators: [What would invalidate core assumptions]
```
