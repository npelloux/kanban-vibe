# Design & dev workflow

The design workflow we use :

1. Understand the problem first (core domain notions & scope)
2. Identify the most valuable releasable product slice
3. Decompose the relève slice in dev tasks, ordered by dependency
4. Dev workflow

* Create ATDD kite level test

* Implement TDD cycle

* Goto next ATDD test

* Release & goto 1-2

## Rules

* Use ATDD & TDD docks double loop
* Use job to be done to initiate the product vision
* Use the kite Sea Fish métaphor to adjust the tasks description to the right level of action verb duration before coding
