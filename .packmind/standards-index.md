# Packmind Standards Index

This standards index contains all available coding standards that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and apply proven practices in coding tasks.

## Available Standards

- [Codebase Structure](./standards/codebase-structure.md) : Monorepo layout and organization principles for maintainable, domain-driven code structure.
- [Design & dev workflow](./standards/design-dev-workflow.md) : Define a design and development workflow in **/*.specs.md using ATDD and TDD double-loop practices, job-to-be-done for product vision, and the kite Sea Fish metaphor for task granularity to ensure focused, testable, and incrementally releasable slices.
- [Software Design Principles](./standards/software-design-principles.md) : Professional software design patterns for writing maintainable, well-structured code.
- [Testing doctrine](./standards/testing-doctrine.md) : Adopt a global ATDD and TDD double-loop testing approach to align features with business requirements while continuously driving design through executable tests.
