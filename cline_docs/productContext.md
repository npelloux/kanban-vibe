# Product Context

## Why this project exists
Kanban Vibe is designed to help teams understand the impact of different task management policies by providing a visual simulation of kanban boards. Users can experiment with various approaches to task prioritization, work-in-progress limits, and resource allocation to see how these decisions affect team productivity and workflow.

## What problems it solves
The project addresses the need for teams to visualize and compare the effects of different task management strategies in a controlled environment.

## How it should work
The website is currently accessible at http://localhost:5173/ when launched locally with "npm run dev". It features an interactive kanban board visualization, multiple task management policy simulations, and day-by-day progression of tasks through the workflow.

## Features (Planned)
- Interactive kanban board visualization
- Multiple task management policy simulations
- Day-by-day progression of tasks through the workflow
