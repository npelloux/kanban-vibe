# Active Context: Windows Development Environment Setup

## Current Work Focus
Setting up a comprehensive Windows development environment with essential tools for software development.

## Recent Changes
- Checked existing tool installations on the system:
  - Git (version 2.36.1.1) is installed
  - Visual Studio Code is installed
  - Node.js (v18.13.0) and npm (9.4.0) are installed
  - Docker (version 20.10.11) is installed
  - Java (version 17.0.1 LTS) is installed
- Identified missing tools:
  - Chocolatey package manager
  - Full Python installation (only Windows Store version available)
  - .NET SDK
  - Maven
- Created Memory Bank documentation structure
- Installed Chocolatey package manager (version 2.4.3)
- Successfully installed Python 3.13.3 and pip 25.0.1 using Chocolatey
- Created PowerShell script (install-dev-tools.ps1) to automate installation of remaining tools
- Created script usage guide (script-usage-guide.md) with detailed instructions
- Enhanced install-dev-tools.ps1 script with:
  - Automatic Chocolatey installation if not already installed
  - Robust error handling for all installation steps
  - Command existence verification
  - Clear status messages and troubleshooting guidance
- Updated script-usage-guide.md to reflect script improvements
- Successfully initialized the Memory Bank structure

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Guide the user through installing Chocolatey package manager
2. ✅ Install Python (full version) using Chocolatey
3. ✅ Enhance installation script with error handling and automatic Chocolatey installation
4. Run the enhanced install-dev-tools.ps1 script to:
   - Install .NET SDK
   - Install Maven
   - Install additional recommended tools
   - Configure Git
   - Install VS Code extensions
5. Verify all installations
6. Document the final environment configuration

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using Chocolatey as the primary package manager for Windows
- Recommending a standard set of tools based on common development needs
- Focusing on command-line installations for reproducibility
- Documenting the entire setup process for future reference
- Considering Windows-specific constraints and workarounds

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- PowerShell is the primary shell for command execution
- Command syntax must be adapted for PowerShell (e.g., using semicolons instead of && for command chaining)
- Installation commands should be run as Administrator
- Tool verification should be done after each installation
- Documentation should be comprehensive and clear

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The user already has several key development tools installed
- PowerShell syntax differs from bash and requires specific command formats
- Windows environment has specific considerations for development setup
- A structured approach to environment setup saves time and reduces errors
- Documentation is essential for maintaining and updating the environment
