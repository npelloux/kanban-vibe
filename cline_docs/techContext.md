# Technical Context: Windows Development Environment

## Technologies Used

### Currently Installed Tools
- **Git**: Version 2.36.1.1 - Version control system
- **Visual Studio Code**: Code editor with extensive plugin support
- **Node.js**: Version 18.13.0 - JavaScript runtime
- **npm**: Version 9.4.0 - Node.js package manager
- **Docker**: Version 20.10.11 - Containerization platform
- **Java**: Version 17.0.1 LTS - Java Development Kit

### Recommended Additional Tools
- **Chocolatey**: Windows package manager
- **Python**: Full version (not just Windows Store version)
- **.NET SDK**: For .NET development
- **Maven**: Java build automation tool
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database
- **Postman**: API testing tool
- **Windows Terminal**: Enhanced terminal experience

## Development Setup

### System Requirements
- Windows 10 or later
- Administrator access for installations
- Sufficient disk space (at least 10GB recommended)
- Minimum 8GB RAM recommended

### Installation Methods
- **Primary**: Chocolatey package manager
- **Secondary**: Direct downloads from official websites
- **Tertiary**: Windows Store (for select applications)

### Environment Variables
- PATH: Automatically updated by most installers
- JAVA_HOME: Set by Java installer
- Other tool-specific variables as needed

## Technical Constraints

### Windows-Specific Considerations
- PowerShell command syntax differs from bash
- Path length limitations (though reduced in recent Windows versions)
- Case-insensitive filesystem
- Windows-specific line endings (CRLF)

### Security Considerations
- Windows Defender may scan development tools
- PowerShell execution policy restrictions
- UAC prompts during installation
- Firewall considerations for network tools

### Performance Considerations
- Antivirus scanning can slow development tools
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) overhead
- Docker for Windows resource requirements

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- PowerShell 5.0+ for scripting
- .NET Framework for certain Windows applications
- Visual C++ Redistributable (installed by many tools)

### Tool Dependencies
- Node.js requires npm (bundled)
- Many development tools require Git
- Some tools require specific Visual C++ versions

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Command Line Tools
- PowerShell as primary shell
- Git Bash for Git operations
- Command Prompt for legacy tools
- Windows Terminal to unify experience

### IDE Integration
- VS Code extensions for language support
- Git integration with editors
- Terminal integration within IDEs

### Containerization
- Docker for isolated environments
- Docker Compose for multi-container applications
- Kubernetes for container orchestration (optional)

## Networking

### Local Development
- localhost for web development
- Port management for multiple services
- Network isolation for containers

### Remote Development
- SSH for remote server access
- Remote repositories for version control
- Cloud service CLI tools
