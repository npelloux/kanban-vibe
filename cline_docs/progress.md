# Progress

- Finished setting up CI/CD and continuous deployment pipeline to ensure fast feedback.
## What works
- The website is currently functional and accessible at http://localhost:5173/ when launched locally with "npm run dev".

## What you're working on now
- Next step is to setup ci cd capabilities on supabase & vercel to validate a full continuous deployment pipeline. Ask for credentials when usefull.

## What's left to build
- ✅ Add a dummy test to validate the testing capabilities of the CI CD pipeline
- ✅ Add a first empty stage colum "TODO"
- ✅ Add a first job to the stage
- ✅ Add a terminal column on the right named "DONE". It will modelise a job/card which has been completed 
- ✅ Add a "next day" button which compute an empty function "stagedone()" on each jobs called with knowing its current stage, then moves from "TODO" to "DONE" if output is true
- ✅ Add a second stage modelised by an intermediary column "dev"
- ✅ Add a "work" button on top of the intermediary column.
- ✅ Generating random names for job cards
- ✅ Adding stages modelised by intermediary columns (red active/finished, blue active/finished, green, done)
- ✅ Adding various colors of activities to be done to complete jobs (red, blue, green)
- ✅ Add three types of workers (red, blue, green) that can be assigned to cards
- ✅ Display completion day for cards in the done column and prevent age updates for those cards
- ✅ Make the 6 column isible without the need to have a slidebar. 
- ✅ Reorganize column headers with activity types in the first row and status in the second row
- ✅ Make the workers attribution using a drag & drop mouse feature. 
- ✅ Implement workers output rules : A worker can work only any active column. It work output is computed when "next day" button is clicked. The output for a worker is computed using these rules : 1st rule "a worker working on a column colored like his own color shall output 1 to 6 boxes of his own color. Meaning : The worker is specialized on its color task. His output is randomly choosen between 1 to 6 like a dice.". 2nd rule : "a worker working on a column of a different color has an output of 0 to 3 boxes of the column color, randomly choosen. Meaning: The worker helps on another task he is not a specialist in, so his output is lower". 
- ✅ Workers should be able to work on the same card up to 3 workers
- ✅ The cards in the blue activities should always be red-complete. Red-complete meaning that all its red works has been completed. Same thing for green column : all red & blue shall be completed; At last : Done cards whould have all work completed.
- ✅ Remove on red worker and one green
- ✅ create another view / tab where we can see a cumulative flow diagram of the activity up-to-date each day please
- ✅ create another tab for a work in progress / card aging per column diagram of the activity up-to-date each day please
- ✅ create another tab including other meaningful flow metrics to study flow
- ✅ Age should not start to be updated till chosen as active - don't update the cards in "options"
- ✅ Create a button to add a random job in options column
- ✅ As we started this project in a BDD / TDD double loop could you had pertinent tests to the project, validating the features & business rules implemented so far
- ✅ make the initialization simpler : start at day zero with no existing cards.
- ✅ remove the "work" buttons.
- ✅ we have a little issue with the kanban board title alignemnt between blue & green activities; Fix it. 
- ✅ remove the options | red active | red finished | blue active | blue  finished | green | done subtitles and replace them by Min & max fields set to zero for now; 
- create a "save context" / "import context pair functionnality that enable to export the current kanban state to a json file when it's saved. Import shall restore the context given a compatible json file; 
- Create max WIP constraint on activities, configurable by the user. If zero there is no constraint. A card cannot move to an activity if the max WIP is reached for the next activity
- create a "policy" feature to automate the run for a given number of days using a preconfigured algorithm. The first policy will be "siloted expert" where workers always work on the cards in their own active color; The finished tasks will go to the next column as soon as possible; The max WIP must be respected at all time


## Progress status
- Added completion day display for cards in the done column
- Prevented age updates for cards in the done column
- Made text bold for cards in the done column
- Made all 6 columns visible without a scrollbar
- Reorganized column headers with activity types in the first row and status in the second row
- Implemented drag & drop functionality for worker attribution
- Added visual feedback during drag & drop operations
- Implemented worker output rules for the "next day" button:
  - Workers specialized in a column's color produce 1-6 work items
  - Workers not specialized in a column's color produce 0-3 work items
- Implemented support for up to 3 workers per card
- Added display of multiple workers on cards
- Implemented completion requirements for cards in different columns:
  - Cards in blue activities must have all red work completed
  - Cards in green column must have all red and blue work completed
  - Done cards must have all work completed
- Modified initialization to start at day 0 with no initial cards:
  - Changed initial day from 7 to 0
  - Removed all initial cards to start with an empty board
  - Updated tests to accommodate the new initialization approach
- Removed "Work" buttons from the application:
  - Removed showWorkButton prop and related code from Column component
  - Removed handleWork function from App.tsx
  - Updated tests to reflect the removal of Work buttons
- Fixed alignment issue between blue and green activities in the kanban board title:
  - Changed the column title from "Green" to "Green Activities" to match the header
  - Ensured consistent naming across the application
- Replaced column subtitles with Min & Max WIP limit fields:
  - Removed the "Active", "Finished", etc. subtitles from all columns
  - Added Min & Max WIP limit fields for each column, initially set to zero
  - Created state to track WIP limits for all columns
  - Added styling for the new WIP limit containers and labels
- Reduced the number of workers to 1 red worker and 1 green worker (from 2 each)
- Implemented tab navigation system for different views
- Created a cumulative flow diagram that tracks and visualizes the number of cards in each column over time
- Implemented WIP & Aging diagram that shows:
  - Individual cards as data points on a scatter plot
  - X-axis representing all columns (Options, Red Active, etc., including Done)
  - Y-axis representing the age of cards in days
  - Each card visualized at its position in the column with its corresponding age
  - Color-coded data points matching their column colors
  - Key metrics like total WIP, WIP limit recommendations, oldest card, and average age
- Implemented Flow Metrics tab with advanced analytics:
  - Lead Time metrics showing average time from start to completion
  - Throughput metrics showing cards completed per day
  - Current WIP metrics
  - Little's Law prediction for lead time based on current WIP and throughput
  - Daily throughput chart showing completed cards by day
  - Rolling average throughput chart showing 5-day moving average
  - WIP over time chart showing how work in progress changes over time
- Modified age tracking to only start when cards are moved from "options" to active columns:
  - Cards in the "options" column no longer age when the "Next Day" button is clicked
  - Age counter only starts incrementing once a card is pulled into the workflow
- Added "Add Card" button to the Options column:
  - Button allows adding new random job cards to the options column
  - New cards are generated with random job titles and work items
  - Card IDs are automatically assigned in sequence (A, B, C, etc.)
- Added comprehensive test suite to validate application features and business rules:
  - Unit tests for all components (Card, Column, Worker, WorkerPool, WorkButton, NextDayButton, TabNavigation)
  - Integration tests for the App component validating core functionality:
    - Rendering the kanban board with all required columns
    - Day counter display and incrementation
    - Worker pool rendering and selection
    - Card addition and movement between columns
    - Age tracking for cards in different columns
    - Tab navigation functionality
  - Tests for the stagedone function that determines card movement between columns
  - All tests are now passing, ensuring the application works as expected
