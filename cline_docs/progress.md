# Progress

## What works
- The website is currently functional and accessible at http://localhost:5173/ when launched locally with "npm run dev".

## What you're working on now
- Next step is to setup ci cd capabilities on supabase & vercel to validate a full continuous deployment pipeline. Ask for credentials when usefull.

## What's left to build
- Add a dummy test to validate the testing capabilities of the CI CD pipeline
- Add a first empty stage colum "TODO"
- Add a first job to the stage
- Add a second stage column "DONE"
- Add a "next day" button which compute an empty function "stagedone()" on each jobs called with knowing its current stage, then moves from "TODO" to "DONE" if output is true
