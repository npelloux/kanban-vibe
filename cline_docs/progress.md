# Progress

- Finished setting up CI/CD and continuous deployment pipeline to ensure fast feedback.
## What works
- The website is currently functional and accessible at http://localhost:5173/ when launched locally with "npm run dev".

## What you're working on now
- Next step is to setup ci cd capabilities on supabase & vercel to validate a full continuous deployment pipeline. Ask for credentials when usefull.

## What's left to build
- ✅ Add a dummy test to validate the testing capabilities of the CI CD pipeline
- ✅ Add a first empty stage colum "TODO"
- ✅ Add a first job to the stage
- ✅ Add a terminal column on the right named "DONE". It will modelise a job/card which has been completed 
- ✅ Add a "next day" button which compute an empty function "stagedone()" on each jobs called with knowing its current stage, then moves from "TODO" to "DONE" if output is true
- ✅ Add a second stage modelised by an intermediary column "dev"
- ✅ Add a "work" button on top of the intermediary column.
- Generating random names for job cards
- Adding stages modelised by intermediary columns
- Adding various colors of activities to be done to complete jobs (one per stage column)
